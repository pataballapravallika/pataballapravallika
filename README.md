## 🧠 Deep Dive (AI / ML Story)

I’m interested in **how machine learning models behave in real settings** —  
how data quality affects outcomes, how models generalize, and how results are communicated clearly.

Through projects and learning communities, I explore:
- Classical & modern ML techniques
- Model evaluation and iteration
- Explainability and decision-making
- AI systems that are understandable, not black boxes

My goal is to grow into an engineer who can **build, reason about, and improve ML systems end-to-end**.
